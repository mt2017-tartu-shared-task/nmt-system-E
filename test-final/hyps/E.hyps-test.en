language , literature , artistic , ima@@ g@@ ina@@ tive art , architecture , hand@@ cra@@ fts , cinema and broadcasting is all part of Europe &apos;s cultural diversity .
the European Union has two objectives : maintaining and supporting this diversity and making it available to others .
the EU cultural industries – cinema and audiovisual industry , publishing , music industry and hand@@ craft – are all important sources of income and job providers , employing around seven million people .
the Union has an economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for European industry to be competitive at international level .
thus , the EU has launched programmes to support the branches of certain cultural industries encouraging them to exploit the opportunities offered by the common market and digital technologies .
the EU also seeks to create a dynamic environment for these industries by facilitating access to finance , contributing to research projects and fostering cooperation with the internal and external partners of the Union .
the Union will also involve the cultural dimension in many its other policies , such as education ( including language learning ) , research , new technologies and information society support and social and regional development .
for example , the European Social Fund is supported by the Italian Ar@@ tur@@ o T@@ os@@ can@@ ini Foundation , which has been organising courses for the unemployed in the mid-@@ 1990s .
the specific objectives of the current cultural programme are to promote awareness of important cultural sites at European level and to promote their preservation ; promote transnational mobility of workers in the cultural sector ; encourage transnational distribution of works and cultural and artistic works ; encourage intercultural dialogue .
&amp; quot ; Media programmes aimed at making the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and competitive have worked since the mid-@@ 1990s .
each year , two cities will be selected as European Ca@@ pi@@ tals of Culture and will also provide them with the right to receive financial support .
linguistic diversity is a cornerstone of the culture and democracy of the European Union .
the language not only opens the door to other cultures , but also provides us with an opportunity to travel to other countries when travelling or working there .
it is estimated that 40 million people in the EU speak language language , which is not the country of origin of their country of origin .
the aim of the common agricultural policy is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers , to provide consumers with a fair price for a fair price and to preserve our land .
the bovine meat and gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics and the dairy la@@ kes are already twenty years past the past wave of reforms .
our main information and entertainment source is television .
every one of us is on average three hours a day news , sports broadcas@@ ts , films and other shows .
the government of each Member State has its audiovisual policy , while the Union lays down rules and guidelines for common interests such as the EU and open borders and fair competition .
in order to protect its cultural diversity and to promote local products , the EU World Trade Organisation requested the so-called cultural exception , which has succeeded in achieving this .
due to the speed of technological innovation , broadcasting and telecommunications have brought together each other .
open borders and affordable transport have provided Europeans with un@@ paralle@@ led personal freedom of movement .
goods will be transported quickly and efficiently to consumers , which may often be in different countries .
the European Union has contributed to the competition by opening the internal market to competition and removing physical and technical barriers .
however , current transport models and growth rates are not sustainable .
the rapid , efficient and cheap transport of people and goods is the guiding objective of the EU &apos;s dynamic economy and a coherent society .
removing barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long-@@ distance transport of goods and passengers .
although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States , it is reasonable for the common European market to have a single transport infrastructure .
over the last ten years the EU has opened public transport markets across the Union , in particular road and air transport and less rail transport .
as a result , lor@@ ries may also take other than domestic countries , so that they do not return to international wars empty .
road transport is now transported by 44 % of all goods in the EU , with 39 % transported by short sea routes , 10 % railways and 34 % of inland waterways .
the transfer of freight and passenger transport to road transport modes is a key factor in any sustainable transport policy .
the European Union ( EU ) is a family of democratic European countries committed to cooperation and prosperity .
the EU is not a country that should replace existing countries as well as not an organisation for international cooperation .
the historic begin@@ nings of the Euro@@ ppa Union go back to the Second World War .
the idea was therefore because Europeans decided to avoid re@@ petition of such slaughter and destruction .
in the early years , six countries cooperated and mainly in the area of trade and economy .
the 27 EU countries and 4@@ 90 million people now belong to the EU and it deals with many different issues that are directly relevant to our daily lives .
Europe is a continent of many different traditions and languages , but it also has common values , such as democracy , freedom and social justice .
in the 21st century , in which countries are increasingly dependent on each other , it is increasingly necessary for every European citizen to do so in a spirit of curi@@ osity , openness and solidarity with people in other countries .
you can travel through a larger part of the EU without passport and without stopping you from border control .
the EU &apos;s story as a ten step from the Schu@@ man Declaration and the six Member States in the 19@@ 50@@ s until 2007 and the 27 Member States .
on 9 May 19@@ 50 , the Schu@@ man Declaration was proposed to establish a European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) , which is the Paris Agreement of 18 April 19@@ 51 .
the customs duties between six countries were completely cancelled on 1 July 1968 and common policies were introduced in the 19@@ 60@@ s , in particular trade and agricultural policy .
in June 1979 , the European Community is a decisive step forward , since the first direct and general elections in the European Parliament took place .
the European political shape changed significantly in the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
in March 2000 the EU adopted the Lisbon Strategy for the modernisation of the European economy and to enable it to compete with other key players in the world market , such as the US and new industrialised countries .
the R@@ än@@ man has so much to discover and the European Union has made it much easier .
you can cross the EU without control and the euro will make it easier for the euro .
the Green Card is not mandatory for travel in the EU , but it is an internationally recognised insurance certificate and simpli@@ fies the requirements of the accident .
the creation of a single European market for air transport has meant lower fares and a wider choice of airlines and services to passengers .
there are 210 000 km of railways in the EU where various international passenger services are offered .
a number of countries have high-speed trains , speeds up to 300 km / h and this year will expand the network with new connections in Belgium , Spain , Italy , the Netherlands , France , Germany and the United Kingdom .
Latvia on the shore of the Baltic is low land with large forest forests from which wood is harvested for the construction and paper industries .
in Latvia , consumer and textile products are also produced in Latvia .
eth@@ n@@ ically , the population comprises 59 % of the population and 29 % of the Russians and over a third of the population in R@@ iga .
Ri@@ iga is the largest city in Bal@@ ti@@ lands , the inhabitants are 7@@ 30 000 .

international Ther@@ monu@@ clear Ex@@ peri@@ mental Re@@ actor , an important test facility designed to demonstrate that fusion energy production is scientific@@ ally and technically feasible .
science and innovation help create jobs , improve prosperity and quality of life .
following successful attempts in recent years , fusion energy research and development have reached point where effective progress can be expected towards fusion energy production .
“ Knowledge is a key factor in competitiveness , ” said Janez Potoč@@ nik , European Research Commissioner .
if our companies have to play a leading role in the future , they must invest in knowledge now and governments must take appropriate measures to help them .
the EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more even@@ ly distributed than ever .
fusion offers an opportunity to produce almost unlimited amounts of clean energy over a long period .
the low level of R &amp; amp ; D spending in Europe compared to the US is mainly due to differences in the industrial fabric and that the European high-@@ tech industry is less .
as far as science is concerned , although the EU is the world &apos;s largest creat@@ or of scientific knowledge , the impact of European science is lower than the US science .
Europe is la@@ gging behind in all scientific discip@@ lines and the number of works quoted in the US .
similarly , universities in the EU are very under@@ represented at the foref@@ ront of the world &apos;s largest universities bi@@ bli@@ cal .
moreover , the link between technology ( paten@@ ted inven@@ tions ) and the scientific base in the EU is much weaker than in the US .
Europe has a difficult breakthrough in the new high-@@ tech industry .
today , the new discovery of R &amp; amp ; D funding began when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch a first European public and private partnership for public and private research .
for our competitiveness and prosperity , Europe needs a new approach in certain promising areas .
this is the areas where research , European level and industry funding will provide much less added value , creating favourable conditions for greater funding for research and development by private sector .
invisible computers ( embedded systems ) nowadays run all machines from cars , planes and phones , from energy networks and plants to washing machines and telev@@ isions .
it is predicted that over 16 billion embedded computing systems will be available by 2010 and over 40 billion devices are available worldwide by 2020 .
by 2010 , they account for 30 to 40 % of the value of the new products in the consumer electronics ( 41 % ) , telecommunications ( 37 % ) , car ( 36 % ) and medical devices ( 33 % ) .
the Innova@@ tive Medicines Initiative will support the development of new knowledge , equipment and methods to enable faster and safer medicines to be deployed .
at present , the European Commission presents its ideas on the European Research Area , which represents most of the potential of Europe &apos;s knowledge .
the Commission aims to introduce this potential , enabling people , infrastructure , organisations , funding sources , knowledge exchange and global cooperation to operate effectively .
a more efficient creation and use of knowledge is essential if the EU wants to achieve its economic , social and societal objectives , listed in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs .
our future depends on whether Europe can become a truly knowledge-based society .
the European Research Area is the basis for a knowledge-based society .
business companies are difficult to create partnerships with universities , in particular universities located in other countries .
researchers still encounter obstacles to the development of careers or other EU research .
the national and regional funding of research is largely un@@ coordinated and thus inefficient .
the use of research results could be significantly improved .
the document is accompanied by guidelines which help research institutions to improve links with industry , highlighting good practice in the management and exchange of knowledge and intellectual property .
sufficiently competent researchers who are very mobile between institutions , discip@@ lines , sectors and countries are one of the main axes .
the aim of the Directive is to achieve a good level of good quality for all rivers , la@@ kes , estu@@ aries , waters , coastal waters and groundwater by 2015 .
sustainable water management is vital to protect biodiversity , the well-being of citizens and the competitiveness of European industries .
participating partners will benefit from greater visibility , greater capacity for research and development , better financial incentives and reduced risk associated costs .
businesses will be directly involved in research and education , thereby contributing to supporting entrepreneurial mind@@ sets among graduates and researchers .
the European Commission has now taken the view on how to best modernise European universities .
European universities have enormous potential , which is a huge part of the lack of rigi@@ d@@ ity and a variety of obstacles .
the release of large knowledge , talent and energy resources requires changing , thorough and coordinated change : from the way systems regulate and manage the management of universities .
although universities training and teaching millions of people every year , there are still many obstacles in European higher education systems , many of which are decades old .
universities are a driving force for knowledge creation .
universities need to adapt to the demands of the global , knowledge-based economy , the same way as to adapt to other sectors of society and economy .
each institution should find a balance between education , research and innovation , which is suited to its role in its region or country .
the aim is to create a framework in which higher education institutions can become stronger players in a global knowledge-based society and economy .
the Commission is ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through the process of identifying and sharing good practice and through their funding programmes for education , research and innovation .
the European Commission has identified nine areas where changes should be made so that European universities can contribute to the creation of a genuine knowledge-based economy .
one of the proposals is to allow students to use national loans and grants across the EU , where they decide to learn or make science .
we need to change national curricula and support schemes so that best students can participate in higher education and continue research careers regardless of their background .
we need to change the funding systems for universities to focus more on the outcome and allow universities greater responsibility for their own long-term financial sustainability , in particular in research .
we need to allow universities greater autonomy and responsibility to respond quickly to changes .
this could include reviewing curricula for adapting them to new developments , setting up closer relations between research areas and focusing on specific research areas instead of specific research areas ( e.g. renewable energy , nano@@ technology ) .
it may also include greater autonomy at the level of a specific institution at the level of study and research staff .
in all EU Member States , seat belts must now be fixed in all vehicles , including tourist buses and micro buses .
observe that in Cyprus , Ireland , Malta and the United Kingdom you are driving on the left side and remember that in some countries , such as Belgium , France , the Netherlands and Portugal , you will normally have to make a better approach to vehicles approaching .
the use of mobile phone during the driving of the vehicle significantly increases the risk of life-threatening accidents and is prohibited in all EU Member States directly or indirectly .
although in most EU Member States the maximum alcoholic strength of alcohol is 0.5 mg / ml , it ranges from 0.2 mg / ml to 0.8 mg / ml ( 0.9 mg / ml in Cyprus ) and in some countries in the blood .
in the EU , the vehicle insurance policy will automatically provide the insurance cover required by the minimum law ( motor insurance ) .
speed limit is generally 110 , 120 or 130 km / h , and it is 50 or sometimes 60 km / h .
as passenger air travel , you have the rights of flight and reservation information , baggage damage , delays and delayed flights , on board accidents , accidents or problems relating to road transport .
these rights apply both to domestic and international routes on flights from one EU airport or outside EU airports to EU air carrier .
new rules have been laid down on liqu@@ ids that passengers can carry out in the cabin in hand luggage .
liqu@@ ids ( including cream , gel@@ s , too@@ th@@ p@@ aste , injec@@ tors , per@@ fu@@ mes ) must be in separate containers with a maximum volume of 100 ml .
passengers shall be allowed to take liqu@@ ids purchased from a flight , such as drinks or per@@ fu@@ mes .
reflecting the will of European citizens and countries to build a common future , the European Union is set up with this Constitution , which Member States attribu@@ te to their common objectives .

in view of the change in society , social progress and scientific and technical progress , it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights by making them clearer in the Charter .
these rights are accompanied by responsibility and responsibilities towards other people , human society and future generations .
the right to marry and the right to establish a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with national legislation governing the exercise of their rights .
everyone has the right to assemb@@ le peace@@ fully and establish associations at all levels , in particular in the area of policy , trade unions and civil society ; this includes the right of everyone to establish and take up their interests .

in the event of an urgent need for changes in the situation and the absence of a Council Decision , Member States may take the necessary urgent measures with a view to the overall objectives of the Joint Action .
the Union policy in this Article shall not affect the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall take into account the obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty , which see their joint protection in the Organisation of North Atlantic Agreement ( NATO ) , in accordance with the common security and defence policy established under this Treaty .
in international organisations and international conferences which do not take part in all Member States , participating Member States shall rely on common positions .
the European Parliament may ask the Council questions or make recommendations .
he has an annual debate on the progress made in implementing the common foreign and security policy .

the governments of each Member State , the European Parliament or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for amending this Agreement .
if two fif@@ ths of the Member States have ratified the Treaty on the signing of this Agreement after the agreement has been signed , but one or more Member States have encountered difficulties in ratification , the issue shall be discussed by the European Council .
the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom Treaty ) was signed in Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958 .
the objective of the Euratom Treaty was to coordinate programmes for peaceful use of nuclear energy already started or in Member States .
this agreement has now been transposed into the EC Treaty in a certain sense .
accession agreements shall include conditions laid down for the accession of new countries to the European Union and the necessary adjustments to the Treaties on which the Union is founded .
the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC Treaty ) is the oldest of the Treaty establishing the European Community and was signed in Paris on 23 July 19@@ 52 and expired on 23 July 2002 as it was signed for 50 years .
the aim of the agreement was to establish a common coal and steel market and was planned to be progressively extended to other economic sectors .
the coal and steel sector is now applying the normal procedure for the EC Treaty .
such agreements shall always be concluded between subjects of international law ( Member States or organisations ) with a view to initiating international cooperation .
international agreements are another source of EU legislation that enables the European Union to develop economic , social and political relations with the rest of the world .
the agreements concluded under the first pillar of the European Union are binding on the Union and the Member States ; the agreements concluded within the Union and the third pillar are binding on the institutions , but not always for Member States .
the Association Agreements include close economic cooperation with a broad financial contribution from the Community to the contractual partner .
cooperation agreements are not as comprehensive as the association agreements , as only close economic cooperation .
trade agreements have been concluded in the framework of customs and trade policy concluded by States or States outside the Union or within the framework of international trade organisations .
agreements between Member States are binding instruments between Member States either to address such issues , which are closely linked to Community activities , but which have not been conferred on the Community institutions , or to extend the boundaries of national provisions to create a single legal instrument ( such as Community patent agreement ) .
secondary legislation is a third largest source of Community legislation after the Treaties ( primary legislation ) and international agreements .
secondary legislation includes binding legislation under the EC Treaty ( regulations , directives and decisions ) and non-binding acts ( resolutions , opinions ) together with a whole range of other acts such as internal rules and Community action programmes .
legislation relating to the second and third pillar , which is not part of secondary legislation , as they continue to be governed by intergovernmental relations , is subject to proper documentation in this category .
a regulation adopted jointly by the Council and the European Parliament is a key measure which all parts are binding .
unlike the directives aimed at the Member States and decisions aimed at specific recipients , regulations are aimed at all .
the regulation is directly applicable , which means that it will create a law that will enter into force in all Member States , as well as a national legislation , without the national authorities in addition to anything .
consolidation consists of the inclusion of a basic act ( the Treaty or any Community legislation ) and subsequent amendments and corrections to one text which is officially not authentic .
the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance shall issue judgments , which may be conc@@ lusive in the case of litigation .

the group went on a mission , despite the warnings of the South Korean government , not to go away from the battle of power .
these two relatives apologi@@ zed when they were released on Monday , and they said they wouldn &apos;t rest until everyone else had been released .
they were involved in the church at the memor@@ ial ceremony of his dead loved ones when the earthquake began .
I have three little boys now , but I don &apos;t have a house because it col@@ lapsed .

there is a lot of talk about inflation in this game , and my job is to determine whether inflation is happening .
it makes consumers more natural , because they compete with each other at various levels , not only at the tac@@ tical level of the fight , but also for logistics and resources .
as a real economic person , I had to spend months looking for data to test the economic theory , but when I was wrong , I wasn &apos;t sure if there was a theory wrong or wrong .

a woman aged 8@@ 1-@@ year-old was brought to a multi@@ disciplinary breast clinic in a better breast .
mam@@ mo@@ graphy and ultras@@ ound study is performed in patients with a particular piece of over 35 years in the usual practice .
mam@@ mo@@ graphy is assessed more widely than other techniques and is still key tools for diagnosis of breast cancer .
if diagnosis of breast cancer is detected , operational ( usually surgical ) treatment can be planned .
does modern breast di@@ ology provide more accurate information about the location of the tumour before the operation ?
patients in hospital have a risk of diagnosis of their diagnosis , associated diseases and increasing age , and the increasingly complex treatment provided by our hospitals .
those working in these procedures must be trained to document these observations , understand their clinical relevance and act accordingly .
it can not be recommended to recommend any specific service configuration as normal methodology , since there is no solid evidence of clinical efficacy .
if the patient considers that taking the patient in intensive care is clinically appropriate , the transfer decision should be taken by a consul@@ tant who has treated both a patient in a ward and an intensive care consul@@ tant .
if a decision is taken to make the patient more intensive than the general public , the transfer should take place within the same day as possible .

we have taken the comments made and we have taken into account as much as possible a compromise with them .

the new disaster movie is going to tell London about the water .
the last major disaster occurred in 19@@ 53 and over 300 people died .
in time , the risk of flooding gradually becomes more real .
on the one hand , climate change is rising because of climate change , but on the other hand , London feels the effects of sin@@ king and a few milli@@ metres each year .
in addition , the increase in the storm caused by the storm is more likely than predicted by climate change .
in order to prevent the floods in London from flooding and save the costs of construction of new floo@@ d@@ gates and barriers , a small amount of land should be allocated to safeguard pressure relief and should hold it up until threat is resolved .
