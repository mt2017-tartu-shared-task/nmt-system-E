Language, literature, artistic, imaginative art, architecture, handcrafts, cinema and broadcasting is all part of Europe's cultural diversity.
The European Union has two objectives: Maintaining and supporting this diversity and making it available to others.
The EU cultural industries – cinema and audiovisual industry, publishing, music industry and handcraft – are all important sources of income and job providers, employing around seven million people.
The Union has an economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for European industry to be competitive at international level.
Thus, the EU has launched programmes to support the branches of certain cultural industries encouraging them to exploit the opportunities offered by the common market and digital technologies.
The EU also seeks to create a dynamic environment for these industries by facilitating access to finance, contributing to research projects and fostering cooperation with the internal and external partners of the Union.
The Union will also involve the cultural dimension in many its other policies, such as education (including language learning), research, new technologies and information society support and social and regional development.
For example, the European Social Fund is supported by the Italian Arturo Toscanini Foundation, which has been organising courses for the unemployed in the mid-1990s.
The specific objectives of the current cultural programme are to promote awareness of important cultural sites at European level and to promote their preservation; promote transnational mobility of workers in the cultural sector; encourage transnational distribution of works and cultural and artistic works; encourage intercultural dialogue.
& quot; Media programmes aimed at making the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and competitive have worked since the mid-1990s.
Each year, two cities will be selected as European Capitals of Culture and will also provide them with the right to receive financial support.
Linguistic diversity is a cornerstone of the culture and democracy of the European Union.
The language not only opens the door to other cultures, but also provides us with an opportunity to travel to other countries when travelling or working there.
It is estimated that 40 million people in the EU speak language language, which is not the country of origin of their country of origin.
The aim of the common agricultural policy is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers, to provide consumers with a fair price for a fair price and to preserve our land.
The bovine meat and gymnastics and the dairy lakes are already twenty years past the past wave of reforms.
Our main information and entertainment source is television.
Every one of us is on average three hours a day news, sports broadcasts, films and other shows.
The government of each Member State has its audiovisual policy, while the Union lays down rules and guidelines for common interests such as the EU and open borders and fair competition.
In order to protect its cultural diversity and to promote local products, the EU World Trade Organisation requested the so-called cultural exception, which has succeeded in achieving this.
Due to the speed of technological innovation, broadcasting and telecommunications have brought together each other.
Open borders and affordable transport have provided Europeans with unparalleled personal freedom of movement.
Goods will be transported quickly and efficiently to consumers, which may often be in different countries.
The European Union has contributed to the competition by opening the internal market to competition and removing physical and technical barriers.
However, current transport models and growth rates are not sustainable.
The rapid, efficient and cheap transport of people and goods is the guiding objective of the EU's dynamic economy and a coherent society.
Removing barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long-distance transport of goods and passengers.
Although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States, it is reasonable for the common European market to have a single transport infrastructure.
Over the last ten years the EU has opened public transport markets across the Union, in particular road and air transport and less rail transport.
As a result, lorries may also take other than domestic countries, so that they do not return to international wars empty.
Road transport is now transported by 44% of all goods in the EU, with 39% transported by short sea routes, 10% railways and 34% of inland waterways.
The transfer of freight and passenger transport to road transport modes is a key factor in any sustainable transport policy.
The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European countries committed to cooperation and prosperity.
The EU is not a country that should replace existing countries as well as not an organisation for international cooperation.
The historic beginnings of the Europpa Union go back to the Second World War.
The idea was therefore because Europeans decided to avoid repetition of such slaughter and destruction.
In the early years, six countries cooperated and mainly in the area of trade and economy.
The 27 EU countries and 490 million people now belong to the EU and it deals with many different issues that are directly relevant to our daily lives.
Europe is a continent of many different traditions and languages, but it also has common values, such as democracy, freedom and social justice.
In the 21st century, in which countries are increasingly dependent on each other, it is increasingly necessary for every European citizen to do so in a spirit of curiosity, openness and solidarity with people in other countries.
You can travel through a larger part of the EU without passport and without stopping you from border control.
The EU's story as a ten step from the Schuman Declaration and the six Member States in the 1950s until 2007 and the 27 Member States.
On 9 May 1950, the Schuman Declaration was proposed to establish a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which is the Paris Agreement of 18 April 1951.
The customs duties between six countries were completely cancelled on 1 July 1968 and common policies were introduced in the 1960s, in particular trade and agricultural policy.
In June 1979, the European Community is a decisive step forward, since the first direct and general elections in the European Parliament took place.
The European political shape changed significantly in the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
In March 2000 the EU adopted the Lisbon Strategy for the modernisation of the European economy and to enable it to compete with other key players in the world market, such as the US and new industrialised countries.
The Ränman has so much to discover and the European Union has made it much easier.
You can cross the EU without control and the euro will make it easier for the euro.
The Green Card is not mandatory for travel in the EU, but it is an internationally recognised insurance certificate and simplifies the requirements of the accident.
The creation of a single European market for air transport has meant lower fares and a wider choice of airlines and services to passengers.
There are 210 000 km of railways in the EU where various international passenger services are offered.
A number of countries have high-speed trains, speeds up to 300 km / h and this year will expand the network with new connections in Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Latvia on the shore of the Baltic is low land with large forest forests from which wood is harvested for the construction and paper industries.
In Latvia, consumer and textile products are also produced in Latvia.
Ethnically, the population comprises 59% of the population and 29% of the Russians and over a third of the population in Riga.
Riiga is the largest city in Baltilands, the inhabitants are 730 000.

International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, an important test facility designed to demonstrate that fusion energy production is scientifically and technically feasible.
Science and innovation help create jobs, improve prosperity and quality of life.
Following successful attempts in recent years, fusion energy research and development have reached point where effective progress can be expected towards fusion energy production.
“Knowledge is a key factor in competitiveness, ” said Janez Potočnik, European Research Commissioner.
If our companies have to play a leading role in the future, they must invest in knowledge now and governments must take appropriate measures to help them.
The EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever.
Fusion offers an opportunity to produce almost unlimited amounts of clean energy over a long period.
The low level of R & amp; D spending in Europe compared to the US is mainly due to differences in the industrial fabric and that the European high-tech industry is less.
As far as science is concerned, although the EU is the world's largest creator of scientific knowledge, the impact of European science is lower than the US science.
Europe is lagging behind in all scientific disciplines and the number of works quoted in the US.
Similarly, universities in the EU are very underrepresented at the forefront of the world's largest universities biblical.
Moreover, the link between technology (patented inventions) and the scientific base in the EU is much weaker than in the US.
Europe has a difficult breakthrough in the new high-tech industry.
Today, the new discovery of R & amp; D funding began when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch a first European public and private partnership for public and private research.
For our competitiveness and prosperity, Europe needs a new approach in certain promising areas.
This is the areas where research, European level and industry funding will provide much less added value, creating favourable conditions for greater funding for research and development by private sector.
Invisible computers (embedded systems) nowadays run all machines from cars, planes and phones, from energy networks and plants to washing machines and televisions.
It is predicted that over 16 billion embedded computing systems will be available by 2010 and over 40 billion devices are available worldwide by 2020.
By 2010, they account for 30 to 40% of the value of the new products in the consumer electronics (41%), telecommunications (37%), car (36%) and medical devices (33%).
The Innovative Medicines Initiative will support the development of new knowledge, equipment and methods to enable faster and safer medicines to be deployed.
At present, the European Commission presents its ideas on the European Research Area, which represents most of the potential of Europe's knowledge.
The Commission aims to introduce this potential, enabling people, infrastructure, organisations, funding sources, knowledge exchange and global cooperation to operate effectively.
A more efficient creation and use of knowledge is essential if the EU wants to achieve its economic, social and societal objectives, listed in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
Our future depends on whether Europe can become a truly knowledge-based society.
The European Research Area is the basis for a knowledge-based society.
Business companies are difficult to create partnerships with universities, in particular universities located in other countries.
Researchers still encounter obstacles to the development of careers or other EU research.
The national and regional funding of research is largely uncoordinated and thus inefficient.
The use of research results could be significantly improved.
The document is accompanied by guidelines which help research institutions to improve links with industry, highlighting good practice in the management and exchange of knowledge and intellectual property.
Sufficiently competent researchers who are very mobile between institutions, disciplines, sectors and countries are one of the main axes.

Businesses will be directly involved in research and education, thereby contributing to supporting entrepreneurial mindsets among graduates and researchers.
The European Commission has now taken the view on how to best modernise European universities.
European universities have enormous potential, which is a huge part of the lack of rigidity and a variety of obstacles.
The release of large knowledge, talent and energy resources requires changing, thorough and coordinated change: From the way systems regulate and manage the management of universities.
Although universities training and teaching millions of people every year, there are still many obstacles in European higher education systems, many of which are decades old.
Universities are a driving force for knowledge creation.
Universities need to adapt to the demands of the global, knowledge-based economy, the same way as to adapt to other sectors of society and economy.
Each institution should find a balance between education, research and innovation, which is suited to its role in its region or country.
The aim is to create a framework in which higher education institutions can become stronger players in a global knowledge-based society and economy.
The Commission is ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through the process of identifying and sharing good practice and through their funding programmes for education, research and innovation.
The European Commission has identified nine areas where changes should be made so that European universities can contribute to the creation of a genuine knowledge-based economy.
One of the proposals is to allow students to use national loans and grants across the EU, where they decide to learn or make science.
We need to change national curricula and support schemes so that best students can participate in higher education and continue research careers regardless of their background.
We need to change the funding systems for universities to focus more on the outcome and allow universities greater responsibility for their own long-term financial sustainability, in particular in research.
We need to allow universities greater autonomy and responsibility to respond quickly to changes.
This could include reviewing curricula for adapting them to new developments, setting up closer relations between research areas and focusing on specific research areas instead of specific research areas (e.g. renewable energy, nanotechnology).
It may also include greater autonomy at the level of a specific institution at the level of study and research staff.
In all EU Member States, seat belts must now be fixed in all vehicles, including tourist buses and micro buses.
